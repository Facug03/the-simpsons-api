He is often either a formidable enemy or an invaluable ally to Bart and Lisa Simpson; mostly, he has a strained relationship with Principal Seymour Skinner. Willie's either originally from the Scottish town of Kirkwall or a place called North Kilttown, which is likely a reference to the hamlet of Domaduir, near Kyle of Lochalsh. Willie is 45 years old.",

Though she can be rude at times, she is very kind to the people she loves and is almost always seen when we see the people of Springfield doing charity or community service. Helen can behave mean and gossipy and is part of a bowling team called The Holly Rollers with members Ned Flanders and Timothy Lovejoy Jr. and ex-member Maude Flanders (deceased) and (most likely) the leader of the Fleet-a-Pita club called the Investorettes with members Agnes Skinner, Luann Van Houten and ex-members Edna Krabappel (deceased), Maude Flanders (deceased) and Marge Simpson, whom the club kicked out in \"The Twisted World Of Marge Simpson\". Helen was often partnered with Maude Flanders as they protested against the \"evils\" in Springfield. Her first line was in \"Life on The Fast Lane\" and it was \"Marge? Marge Simpson. You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy the gossipy wife of the Minister.\" Her catchphrase, “Won't somebody please think of the children?\" is used quite often but sometimes, they replace the word \"children\" with a different word like in \"Thanksgiving of Horror\", she says \"The Pilgrims! Won't somebody please think of the Pilgrims?\". Also, in \"Pulpit Friction\", she says \"Why won't somebody blame the children?”. Whenever Ned calls Reverend Lovejoy she says her second catchphrase, “Ned Flanders is on the phone.\"",
